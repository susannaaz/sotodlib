    """This function sets up the execution environment for parallel processing based on the specified priority list.

    Since this function returns a rank value the main function needs to go under an
    >>> if rank == 0

    block to ensure that the code is only run by the master process.

    In addition the main function needs to take the executor and as_completed_callable as arguments.

    Let's assume that the main function is called main_func and it current state is as follows:
    >>> def main_func():
    >>>     with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    >>>         futures = []
    >>>         for i in range(10):
    >>>             futures.append(executor.submit(some_func, i))
    >>>         for future in as_completed(futures):
    >>>             result = future.result()
    >>>             print(result)
    >>> if __name__ == "__main__":
    >>>     main_func()


    Utilizing different executors requires to change the main function as follows:
    >>> def main_func(executor, as_completed_callable):
    >>>      futures = []
    >>>     for i in range(10):
    >>>         futures.append(executor.submit(some_func, i))
    >>>     for future in as_completed_callable(futures):
    >>>         result = future.result()
    >>>         print(result)
    >>> if __name__ == "__main__":
    >>>     rank, executor, as_completed_callable = get_exec_env(nprocs=4)
    >>>     if rank == 0:
    >>>         main_func(executor, as_completed_callable)


    Parameters
    ----------
    nprocs : int, optional
        The number of processes to use for the process pool executor. If not specified, the default is None.
    priority : List[str], optional

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the executor was created successfully or not. This is important under MPI as the executor is only returned in rank 0. All other ranks have None as an executor.
    int
        The rank of the process that is the master process for this type of execution

    Union["MPICommExecutor", "ProcessPoolExecutor"]
        The executor that is used to run the code in parallel. This can be either an MPICommExecutor or a ProcessPoolExecutor depending on the execution environment.

    Callable
        The as_completed function that is used to get the results of the parallel execution based on the type of the executor

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When a valid executor is not available based on the execution priority list.
